<h1>Homework 6.2: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>
<h2>Salem Reaves</h2>
<h3>Ratio is 1:100 so that chloropleth can be displayed using percentages, since the numbers being referenced are relatively small and don't quite justify a 1:100,000 ratio, for example.</h3>
<br>

<h3>Fixed Interval</h3>
    <p>Pros: Numbers are easy to read and understand; communicates data in a way that makes sense to the viewer.</p>
    <p>Cons: It can be difficult to distinguish the scale of each class.</p>

<h3>Natural Breaks</h3>
    <p>Pros: Classes are grouped so that counties with similar data aren't split; groupings make sense visually.</p>
    <p>Cons: Can't be used to compare multiple datasets; despite looking good it can be hard to understand the groupings without seeing the raw data.</p>

<h3>Equal Count (Quantile)</h3>
    <p>Pros: You can distinguish the highest and lowest ranges visually; groups are evenly represented.</p>
    <p>Cons: Counties with similar percentages may be broken up into different classes, and ones with vastly different percentages may be grouped together, making the chloropleth potentially misleading.</p>
