<h3>Buildings in the 100 ft. Critical Zone Buffer in Riviera Beach, Maryland.</h3>
    <p>The state of Maryland preserves a 100 ft. buffer along the bay's coastline. I was interested in zooming in on an area and looking at what is within that buffer.</p>
    <p>While the buffer mostly consists of shrubs, trees, and grasses, there are areas with residential property within the buffer that contain lawns and buildings.</p>

There is a green buffer of 100 feet on either side of the coastline. Segments of buildings that fall within the coastal side of the buffer are represented with orange polygons" width='500px'>

<h3>Geoprocessing:</h3>
    <p>1. Clipped the national coastlines with the Maryland state boundary to get a more precise bay coastline.</p>
    <p>2. Buffer 100 ft. from coastline (calculated 100/364,000 to approximate feet into decimal degrees).</p>
    <p>3. Clipped building footprints with buffer to highlight segments contained inside of buffer.</p>
